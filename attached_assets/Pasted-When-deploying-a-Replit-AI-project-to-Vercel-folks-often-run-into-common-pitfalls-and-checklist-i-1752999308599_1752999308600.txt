When deploying a Replit AI project to Vercel, folks often run into **common pitfalls and checklist items** that trip things up. Here are the main areas to audit:

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Essential Deployment Checklist

### 1. **Dependencies & Build Commands**

* ‚úÖ Run `npm install` before attempting a build/deploy ‚Äî missing packages cause breakage ([Reddit][1]).
* Ensure build commands are split correctly:

  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run build
  ```

  instead of chaining them in a single command ([Reddit][1]).

---

### 2. **`vercel.json` Setup**

* Include correct builds:

  ```json
  "builds": [
    { "src": "dist/index.js", "use": "@vercel/node" },
    { "src": "package.json", "use": "@vercel/static-build", "config": { "distDir": "dist/public" } }
  ]
  ```
* Set routes so `/api/*` go to your serverless function and other paths serve frontend ([Neon][2], [Medium][3]).

---

### 3. **Project Structure Compatibility**

* Your folder layout must match what‚Äôs configured in `vercel.json`. Mismatches (e.g. wrong `dist` path or misconfigured routes) will result in 404s ([Vercel Community][4]).
* If you're using Express, ensure your route definitions and entrypoint align with Vercel settings.

---

### 4. **GitHub Integration**

* Export or sync your Replit project to GitHub first:

  1. Delete Replit-specific files (`.replit`, `attached_assets/`).
  2. Push to GitHub.
  3. Connect the repo to Vercel for automatic deploy on commit ([Constanze Kratel][5], [Medium][6]).

---

### 5. **Port Configuration for Next.js**

* Ensure the dev server uses port **3000**, not Replit‚Äôs default **5000**. Use scripts like:

  ```json
  "dev": "next dev --port 3000",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
  ```

  ([Medium][6]).

---

### 6. **Clear `.gitignore` / File Hygiene**

* Ignore Replit-specific files and folders.
* Ensure only necessary build output and config files are tracked ([Medium][6]).

---

### 7. **Environment Variables**

* Set your ENV vars (like API keys) in Vercel‚Äôs dashboard ‚Äî missing these can cause silent failures.

---

### 8. **Verify Locally First**

* Before linking to Vercel, run:

  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

  Ensure it works locally (as one user noted: ‚Äúif it doesn‚Äôt run locally, it likely won‚Äôt deploy properly‚Äù ) ([Medium][3], [Medium][6]).

## üß† Community Insights

From r/replit:

> ‚Äúnpm command not found in PATH environment‚Ä¶ Missing build step‚Ä¶‚Äù ([Reddit][1])
> ‚ÄúFix the run command syntax by separating npm install and npm run dev‚Äù ([Reddit][1])

Outro: ‚ÄúReplit won‚Äôt deploy‚Ä¶ suggested I switch to Vercel‚Ä¶‚Äù sourced from support ([Reddit][1]).

## ‚úÖ Quick Summary

1. **Install dependencies** separately.
2. **Split build commands** ‚Äî don't chain them.
3. **Define correct builds/routes** in `vercel.json`.
4. **Match your folder structure**.
5. **Use GitHub export**: no Replit files, clean repo.
6. **Set port to 3000** for Next.js/Node.
7. **Add ENV vars** in Vercel dashboard.
8. **Test locally before deploying**.

Cover these, and your Replit AI ‚Üí Vercel pipeline should be solid. Want me to draft a sample `vercel.json` or scripts for your specific stack?
